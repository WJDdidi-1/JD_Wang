            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>Greetings! I'm Jiandi (Felix) Wang, a passionate explorer in the realm of Electrical Engineering. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Virginia, where I'm diving deep into cutting-edge technologies and their real-world applications.</p>
            <p>My research interests lie at the exciting intersection of signal processing, medical imaging, and AI hardware. I'm fascinated by the potential of advanced signal processing techniques to revolutionize medical imaging, and I'm equally intrigued by the development of specialized hardware to accelerate AI algorithms. These areas not only challenge me intellectually but also offer the promise of significant societal impact.</p>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of circuits and algorithms, you might find me sinking three-pointers on the basketball court or engaged in an intense table tennis match. My love for problem-solving extends beyond the lab - whether it's decoding complex systems or strategizing my next move in a computer game, I'm always up for a challenge!</p>
            <p>I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems. My background in measurement and control technology, combined with my current focus on electrical engineering, positions me uniquely to bridge gaps between different technological domains.</p>
            <p>Let's connect and explore the fascinating intersections of technology, innovation, and fun! I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in electrical engineering and its applications in healthcare and AI.</p>
